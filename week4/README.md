# Week 4: Program Structure 

## Class Plan
* Greetings &amp; Introductions 
* Dialogue + Questions: Review problems on homework.
* Look at binary converter as an example of an iterative algorithm. Explain why the algorithm works.
* Small Group Problem Solving: Complete the problems at the end of chapter 2 of Eloquent Javascript. Finish any remaining problems of interest from chapter 1 + 2, especially if someone in the group got stuck on it. 
* Go over homework and topics for chapter 3. 
* Logistics Questions and Wrap-up

## Homework Reading 
* [Eloquent Javascript Chapter 3](https://eloquentjavascript.net/03_functions.html)
* [Free Code Camp, Basic Data Structures](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-data-structures/use-an-array-to-store-a-collection-of-data). Note that this is distinctly different content from Chapter 3 of eloquent JS. This section of free code camp should give us tools to solve the algorithm challenges in basic algorithm scripting while giving us some hands-on experience to contextualize the up-coming chapter 4 of eloquent JS.
* [Optional: MDN Article on Closures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures)

## Recommended Homework Problems List
* Attempt each problem at the end of eloquent javascript chapter 3. I'm curious how difficult or easy you'll find these at this point in the class.
* Complete the [basic algorithm scripting](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-algorithm-scripting) challenges on FreeCodeCamp. You're prepared to solve the problems involving strings without having first completed the basic data structures section. For problems involving arrays and objects, it will help to learn the material from basic data structures first.
* Re-write answers to the basic algorithm scripting challenges you've already solved using iteration (also known as looping) using recursive function calls instead. Anything that can be written iteratively can be written recursively and vice versa. Recursion is a crazy thing, the basic premise of which is central to all of computer science.
