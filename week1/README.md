# Week 1: Problem Solving and Computation

## Class Plan
* Greetings &amp; Introductions 
* Overview of Course Goals and Structure
* Talk: "What is Computation?"
* Small Group Session: Set up 3 javascript environments.
* Dialogue: Work Trough Code Example in Eloquent Javascript Introduction. 
* Logistics Questions and Wrap-up

## Reading & Videos
* [Eloquent Javascript Introduction](http://eloquentjavascript.net/00_intro.html)
* [Eloquent Javascript Chapter 1](http://eloquentjavascript.net/01_values.html)
* [Khan Academy: Introduction to Number Systems](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home/alg-intro-to-algebra/algebra-alternate-number-bases/v/number-systems-introduction)
* [Khan Academy: Convert from Decimal to Binary](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home/alg-intro-to-algebra/algebra-alternate-number-bases/v/decimal-to-binary)

## Recommended Problems List
* Play around with each new concept you encounter in eloquent JS chapter 1 in your own javascript environment.
* Convert the following decimal numbers into binary by hand: 1,5,7, 100, 112, 128, 200, and 255. If you get stuck for more than 15 minutes, use these [binary cards](http://csfieldguide.org.nz/en/interactives/binary-cards/index.html) to help you.
* Follow along FreeCodeCamp's [Introduction to Javascript](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript), "Comment your Javascript Code" through "Word Blanks" and "Understanding Boolean Values" through "Golf Code." These are more like simple drills than tricky puzzles. We need some simple nouns and verbs to start building more interesting programs.
* Optional: Invent a method to represent the lower-case letters of the standard english alphabet in binary. Does this help convince you that you can represent almost anything as binary data?
