## Course Philosophy:
#### "The better you understand what you are doing, the better you will do it." - Max Kanat-Alexander
A conceptual foundation is a set of deeply internalized mental tools that make new concepts easier to grasp. This course aims to help beginners build such a conceptual basis for continued learning in computer science and programming. The course aims at developing a precise understanding of a small set of universal ideas rather than a fuzzy understanding of a broad range of ideas. 

This means that specific topics which might be important to finding your first job as a programmer won't be covered. However, it also means that you'll have the foundational mental tools to study those topics efficiently.

## Goals
The conceptual foundation we will build together consists of the following:
* Understanding the nature of computers and programs.
* Finding effective patterns for thinking about logical problems in general.
* Practical programming experience (with Javascript).
* Practical experience creating web applications (with Javascript).

## What you'll be doing
The course should take participants about 10 hours a week for 3.5 months (14 weeks). We feel that spending significantly less than this may not result in the kind of consistent practice required to develop the deep mental skills for programming.

Class time will be primarily dedicated to solving problems in small groups, with the occasional informal review of the reading material as needed. Once in a while, a short talk may be given to provide deeper technical background on something.

Reading will be assigned primarily from the free, online book "eloquent javascript" with additional problems and resources drawn from a range of sources. Projects suitable for a professional portfolio will be pursued in the second half of the curriculum.

#### Typical Week:
##### Class
* Interactive Concept Review and Questions: 30 Minutes
* Group Problem Solving on Algorithm Challenges: 1.5 hours.
##### Independent Work
* 2 Hours of Reading
* 6 Hours of Independent Exercises and Projects
