## In-Class Problems List
* Create an array with the names of everyone in your group and log the names one by one using a while loop.
* Write a program that can log the sum of the numbers from 1 to 10, 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 10. How about 1 to 1000?
* Write a program that logs the sum of the first 50 even numbers using a while loop. How about the odd numbers? How about for values other than 50?
* Write a program that can log the product of the numbers from 1 to 10, 1 * 2 * 3, * ... * 10. How about 1 to 1000?
* Using '+' between two strings will stick them together. For example, 'cat'+'dog' returns 'catdog.'This is called "concatenation". Write a program that will take an array of strings such as ['cat','dog','lizard'] and log the array elements as a single string seperated by spaces such as 'cat dog lizard'.  
* TODO: Add harder puzzle problems
